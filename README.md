## ds-for-telco

This project demonstrates how to use the common utilized demo, DS for telco, to highlight the experiments and models API features in CDSW. 

use python 2.7 / 2 CPU / 4 GB

1. dsfortelcointeractive.py simulates interactive DS work. 
2. dsfortelco_pyspark_exp.py and dsfortelco_sklearn_exp.py can be used with the experiments functionality. You can input 3 arguments, num trees, max depth, and impurity method to test a variety of scenarios which will be tracked by cdsw experiments.  
3. predict_churn_pyspark.py and predict_churn_sklearn.py can be used as the endpoints for the model APIs.
